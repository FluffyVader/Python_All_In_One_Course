# Exercise 18: Check if a given year is a leap year
# A leap year is a year in the Gregorian calendar that contains an extra day, making it 366 days long instead of the usual 365. This extra day, 
# February 29th, is added to keep the calendar synchronized with the Earthâ€™s revolution around the Sun.

# Generally, a year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4. 
# However, there's an exception: if the year is divisible by 100, it's not a leap year unless it's also divisible by 400.
